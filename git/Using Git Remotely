# create absolutely blank repo on github.com
# create a dir for it on computer
# cd into it
git init
git remote add origin <urlAtGitHub>
git remote -v # to check remotes
git push -u origin master  # -u is for tracking the branch if pushing first time
# then we can just print 'git push' instead of git push -u origin master 
git push origin <branchName> # to push a new branch
git push origin --delete <branchName>  # to delete a branch on remote
